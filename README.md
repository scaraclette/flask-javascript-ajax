# Flask-JavaScript-Ajax
## Background
<p>This project is a three code compilation of using Ajax requests through a Flask application and JavaScript. I did this project to teach myself the basics of sending XMLHTTP requests through client and server. By mastering the basics of Ajax, it will be easier to create single-page web applications. This repo will also be useful for those who are starting to learn Ajax requests and wanting to create a dynamic page from JavaScript</p>

## Required
Python3 & Flask

## Installing
On working directory
```
$ export FLASK_APP=application.py
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
$ flask run
```

## Other notes
The main directory includes the whole compilation, but I also separated each code to individual forlders for further clarity.

    TODO: write about
    1. confused about connecting JS, Ajax, FLASK
    2. confused about knowing the difference between using jsonify vs json.dumps in Flask and why we use JSON.parse() in JS
    3. Initialize an XMLHTTP request in JS
    4. Updating child elements within a parent element and avoid the mistake of having a breakspace.
